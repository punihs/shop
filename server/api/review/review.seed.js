Saneel - who is one of the relationship managers, ensured from the pick up to the the delivery - i was informed every step of the way. Will definitely use this service again and openly recommend. Package was delivered in 3 days. UPS was charging me 7.5k for the same package. Shoppre used FEdex to deliver. Haha UPS. You lose business...AGAIN. Thank you Shoppre. You guys are Awesome",

  description: 'Important feedback at the end. Well, it was my first experience of an international courier to my GF in the USA and I was really confused with all the import laws and furious with the price that was being asked by big courier companies. After searching a lot on Google I came across this startup and to be honest I was really skeptical as their quoted price was half of what everyone else was asking. For next few days, I called their office with many doubts and queries and every time Mr. Saneel was really-really friendly and helpful. Still, I was not convinced as I thought it was some kind of scam, so I decided to visit their office(even though they had a home pickup option). Some renovation was going on at their office but still, I chose to trust Mr. Saneel and left my box at their office. From there on everything went smooth as they kept my box in the locker because I ordered some sweets from Jodhpur and it was delayed. They gave me an address to reroute my sweets packets directly to their office and once it was received they packed the entire box and I was given a DHL courier receipt as promised, Not just that but Mr. Saneel was even kind enough to purchase one small pooja item for me as I forgot to put it in the box and it was very important for her. During whole time they kept me updated via WhatsApp and needless to say that my courier was well received within 5 days including the weekend. Overall I am 100% satisfied with the customer support, service and needless to say their price is unbeatable.\nFEEDBACK:  Kindly add a proper payment gateway like visa/MasterCard or even net banking. The only payment option available right now is either via Paytm or your bank account numbers which is neither professional nor trustworthy for a new customer. Even I had the problem with this payment system like some others as even my payment via Paytm gateway was not processed timely. I wanted to give you guys 3 or 4 stars just because of this payment issue but I still went with 5-star as the support and service provided by Mr. Saneel during the whole process were wonderful.',

I wanted to order an item in India and shipped to the US, but I did not have an Indian credit card.  They had their "personal shopper" purchase the item and shipped to the US.  They give you updates throughout the process and there was a good amount of communication throughout.  Their pricing and service is also quoted very well.  I will definitely recommend them to everyone I know and will use this service again soon.',

Invoice was sent only a day before the item was delivered. Everytime to check the status I had to call and ask as that was not updated in their site against my order. This package would have delivered in 3-4 days thru other service, here it took 2 weeks. So overall I was unhappy with the service.',
