                          | Many Indian stores pack their merchandise inefficiently, resulting in substantially higher shipping costs for international customers. There are also other things to know when shopping Indian retailers. To save the most at Indian stores, follow these tips:
                      p(style='padding-left: 30px;')
                        span(style='font-weight: 400;')
                          | 1. Always use your Shoppre locker address as the "Ship To" address. Many sellers offer free shipping to Indian addresses.
                      p(style='padding-left: 30px;')
                        span(style='font-weight: 400;')
                          | 2. Always select "Indian Rupees" when shopping. Many Indian stores offer multiple currency options. However, if you select a Non-INR currency, the store may apply a less favorable exchange rate to protect itself against fluctuating exchange rates. The result is that you may pay more than you should for the product.
                      p(style='padding-left: 30px;')
                        span(style='font-weight: 400;') 3. Check to see if coupons or discount codes are available.
                      p(style='padding-left: 30px;')
                        span(style='font-weight: 400;') 4. Be sure to read the ratings and reviews of sellers.
                      p(style='padding-left: 30px;')
                        span(style='font-weight: 400;')
                          | 5. Be prepared to spend more than a few minutes on these sites looking for the best products and deals.
                      p(style='padding-left: 30px;')
                        span(style='font-weight: 400;')
                          | 6. There are typically multiple ways to get to a product; by category, price, features, etc.

                        span(style='font-weight: 400;')
                          | 7. Consider rebates; sometimes manufacturers offer rebates after the product is purchased.
                      p(style='padding-left: 30px;')
                        span(style='font-weight: 400;')
                          | 8. If you are unsure about a seller or retailer, check with the Better Business Bureau.

                        span(style='font-weight: 400;') 9. Shop around! Check different websites for the same product.

                        span(style='font-weight: 400;')
                          | 10. Create a separate email address for shopping, so your email doesn't get bogged down with advertisements.
